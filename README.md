# PDFPageExtractor

## Why did I create it?

I needed to extract from a long PDF file all the pages that contained at least one of the name in a list.

## How does it work?

I personally published the app as a self contained executable but is up to you how to distribute it.
Run the interface and it will require the paths of the files involved in the process, press the "extract" button and it is done.
