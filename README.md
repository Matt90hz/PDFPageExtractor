# PDFPageExtractor

## Why did I create it?

I needed to extract from a long PDF file all the pages that contained at least one of the name in a list.

## How does it work?

Simply run the self contained WPF app in the publish folder. The user interface will require the paths of the files involved in the process, press the "extract" button and it is done.
